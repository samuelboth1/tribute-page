                <h3>Childhood</h3>
                <p>Paul and Clara adopted Jobs's sister Patricia in 1957 and by 1959 the family had
                    moved to the Monta Loma neighborhood in Mountain View, California. It was during this 
                    time that Paul built a workbench in his garage for his son in order to "pass along his love of 
                    mechanics." Jobs, meanwhile, admired his father's craftsmanship "because he knew how to 
                    build anything. If we needed a cabinet, he would build it. When he built our fence, he gave me 
                    a hammer so I could work with him ... I wasn't that into fixing cars ... but I was eager to hang out
                    with my dad." By the time he was ten, Jobs was deeply involved in electronics and befriended many 
                    of the engineers who lived in the neighborhood. He had difficulty making friends with children his own age, 
                    however, and was seen by his classmates as a "loner."
                </p>
                <p>Jobs had difficulty functioning in a traditional classroom, tended to resist authority figures, frequently 
                    misbehaved, and was suspended a few times. Clara had taught him to read as a toddler, and 
                    Jobs stated that he was "pretty bored in school and [had] turned into a little terror... you should have seen 
                    us in the third grade, we basically destroyed the teacher." He frequently played pranks on 
                    others at Monta Loma Elementary School in Mountain View. His father Paul (who was abused as a child) never 
                    reprimanded him, however, and instead blamed the school for not challenging his brilliant son
                </p>
                <p>Jobs would later credit his fourth grade teacher, Imogene "Teddy" Hill, with turning him around: 
                    "She taught an advanced fourth grade class and it took her about a month to get hip to my situation. 
                    She bribed me into learning. She would say, 'I really want you to finish this workbook. I'll give you five 
                    bucks if you finish it.' That really kindled a passion in me for learning things! I learned more that year 
                    than I think I learned in any other year in school. They wanted me to skip the next two years in grade school 
                    and go straight to junior high to learn a foreign language but my parents very wisely wouldn't let it happen."
                    Jobs skipped the fifth grade and transferred to the sixth grade at Crittenden Middle School in 
                    Mountain View where he became a "socially awkward loner". Jobs "was often bullied" at 
                    Crittenden Middle, and in the middle of seventh grade, he gave his parents an ultimatum: they had to either take 
                    him out of Crittenden or he would drop out of school.
                </p>
                <p>Though the Jobs family was not well off, they used all their savings in 1967 to buy a new home, allowing Jobs to change 
                    schools. The new house (a three-bedroom home on Crist Drive in Los Altos, California) was in the 
                    better Cupertino School District, Cupertino, California, and was embedded in an environment that was even more 
                    heavily populated with engineering families than the Mountain View area was. The house was declared a 
                    historic site in 2013, as it was the first site for Apple Computer; as of 2013, it was owned by Patty and occupied 
                    by Jobs's step-mother, Marilyn. When he was 13 in 1968, Jobs was given a summer job by Bill Hewlett (of Hewlett-Packard) 
                    after Jobs cold-called him to ask for parts for an electronics project</p>

                <p>In February 1974, Jobs returned to his parents' home in Los Altos and began looking for a job. He was soon hired by Atari, Inc. 
                    in Los Gatos, California, which gave him a job as a technician. Back in 1973, Steve Wozniak designed his own version of 
                    the classic video game Pong and gave the board to Jobs. According to Wozniak, Atari only hired Jobs because he took the board down to
                    the company, and they thought that he had built it himself. Atari's cofounder Nolan Bushnell later described him as "difficult but 
                    valuable", pointing out that "he was very often the smartest guy in the room, and he would let people know that."
                </p>
                <p>During this period, Jobs and Brennan remained involved with each other while continuing to see other people. 
                    By early 1974, Jobs was living what Brennan describes as a "simple life" in a Los Gatos cabin, working at Atari, and saving money 
                    for his impending trip to India.
                </p>
                <p>Jobs traveled to India in mid-1974 to visit Neem Karoli Baba at his Kainchi ashram with his Reed friend (and eventual Apple
                    employee) Daniel Kottke, in search of spiritual enlightenment. When they got to the Neem Karoli ashram, it was almost deserted 
                    because Neem Karoli Baba had died in September 1973. Then they made a long trek up a dry riverbed to an ashram of Haidakhan Babaji.
                </p>
                <p>After seven months, Jobs left India and returned to the US ahead of Daniel Kottke. Jobs had changed his appearance; his head 
                    was shaved and he wore traditional Indian clothing. During this time, Jobs experimented with psychedelics, later calling 
                    his LSD experiences "one of the two or three most important things [he had] done in [his] life". He spent a period at the 
                    All One Farm, a commune in Oregon that was owned by Robert Friedland. Brennan joined him there for a period.   
                </p>
                <p>During this time period, Jobs and Brennan both became practitioners of Zen Buddhism through the Zen master Kōbun Chino Otogawa. 
                    Jobs was living in his parents' backyard toolshed, which he had converted into a bedroom. Jobs engaged in 
                    lengthy meditation retreats at the Tassajara Zen Mountain Center, the oldest Sōtō Zen monastery in the US. He considered 
                    taking up monastic residence at Eihei-ji in Japan, and maintained a lifelong appreciation for Zen.
                </p>
                <p>In mid-1975, after returning to Atari, Jobs was assigned to create a circuit board for the arcade video game Breakout.
                    According to Bushnell, Atari offered US$100 for each TTL chip that was eliminated in the machine. Jobs had little specialized 
                    knowledge of circuit board design and made a deal with Wozniak to split the fee evenly between them if Wozniak could minimize 
                    the number of chips. Much to the amazement of Atari engineers, Wozniak reduced the TTL count to 46, a design so tight that it 
                    was impossible to reproduce on an assembly line. According to Wozniak, Jobs told him that Atari gave them only $700 (instead 
                    of the $5,000 paid out), and that Wozniak's share was thus $350. Wozniak did not learn about the actual bonus until ten 
                    years later, but said that if Jobs had told him about it and explained that he needed the money, Wozniak would have given it to him.
                </p>
                <p>Jobs and Wozniak attended meetings of the Homebrew Computer Club in 1975, which was a stepping stone to the development and marketing 
                    of the first Apple computer.

                <p>By March 1976, Wozniak completed the basic design of the Apple I computer and showed it to Jobs, who suggested that they sell it; 
                    Wozniak was at first skeptical of the idea but later agreed. In April of that same year, Jobs, Wozniak, and administrative overseer 
                    Ronald Wayne founded Apple Computer Company (now called Apple Inc.) as a business partnership in Jobs's parents' Crist Drive home 
                    on April 1, 1976. The operation originally started in Jobs's bedroom and later moved to the garage. Wayne stayed only a short time, 
                    leaving Jobs and Wozniak as the active primary cofounders of the company. The two decided on the name "Apple" after Jobs returned 
                    from the All One Farm commune in Oregon and told Wozniak about his time spent in the farm's apple orchard. Jobs originally planned 
                    to produce bare printed circuit boards of the Apple I and sell them to computer hobbyists for $50 each. To raise the money they needed 
                    to build the first batch of the circuit boards, Wozniak sold his HP scientific calculator and Jobs sold his Volkswagen van. Later that 
                    year, computer retailer Paul Terrell purchased 50 fully assembled units of the Apple I from them for $500 each. Eventually about 200 
                    Apple I computers were produced in total.
                </p>
                <p>A neighbor on Crist Drive recalled Jobs as an odd individual who would greet his clients "with his underwear hanging out, barefoot 
                    and hippie-like". Another neighbor, Larry Waterland, who had just earned his PhD in chemical engineering at Stanford, recalled 
                    dismissing Jobs's budding business: "'You punched cards, put them in a big deck,' he said about the mainframe machines of that time. 
                    'Steve took me over to the garage. He had a circuit board with a chip on it, a DuMont TV set, a Panasonic cassette tape deck and a keyboard.
                    He said, 'This is an Apple computer.' I said, 'You've got to be joking.' I dismissed the whole idea.'" Jobs's friend from Reed College and 
                    India, Daniel Kottke, recalled that as an early Apple employee, he "was the only person who worked in the garage ... Woz would show up once a 
                    week with his latest code. Steve Jobs didn't get his hands dirty in that sense." Kottke also stated that much of the early work took place in 
                    Jobs's kitchen, where he spent hours on the phone trying to find investors for the company.</p>
