                <h3>Childhood</h3>
                <p>Paul and Clara adopted Jobs's sister Patricia in 1957 and by 1959 the family had
                    moved to the Monta Loma neighborhood in Mountain View, California. It was during this 
                    time that Paul built a workbench in his garage for his son in order to "pass along his love of 
                    mechanics." Jobs, meanwhile, admired his father's craftsmanship "because he knew how to 
                    build anything. If we needed a cabinet, he would build it. When he built our fence, he gave me 
                    a hammer so I could work with him ... I wasn't that into fixing cars ... but I was eager to hang out
                    with my dad." By the time he was ten, Jobs was deeply involved in electronics and befriended many 
                    of the engineers who lived in the neighborhood. He had difficulty making friends with children his own age, 
                    however, and was seen by his classmates as a "loner."
                </p>
                <p>Jobs had difficulty functioning in a traditional classroom, tended to resist authority figures, frequently 
                    misbehaved, and was suspended a few times. Clara had taught him to read as a toddler, and 
                    Jobs stated that he was "pretty bored in school and [had] turned into a little terror... you should have seen 
                    us in the third grade, we basically destroyed the teacher." He frequently played pranks on 
                    others at Monta Loma Elementary School in Mountain View. His father Paul (who was abused as a child) never 
                    reprimanded him, however, and instead blamed the school for not challenging his brilliant son
                </p>
                <p>Jobs would later credit his fourth grade teacher, Imogene "Teddy" Hill, with turning him around: 
                    "She taught an advanced fourth grade class and it took her about a month to get hip to my situation. 
                    She bribed me into learning. She would say, 'I really want you to finish this workbook. I'll give you five 
                    bucks if you finish it.' That really kindled a passion in me for learning things! I learned more that year 
                    than I think I learned in any other year in school. They wanted me to skip the next two years in grade school 
                    and go straight to junior high to learn a foreign language but my parents very wisely wouldn't let it happen."
                    Jobs skipped the fifth grade and transferred to the sixth grade at Crittenden Middle School in 
                    Mountain View where he became a "socially awkward loner". Jobs "was often bullied" at 
                    Crittenden Middle, and in the middle of seventh grade, he gave his parents an ultimatum: they had to either take 
                    him out of Crittenden or he would drop out of school.
                </p>
                <p>Though the Jobs family was not well off, they used all their savings in 1967 to buy a new home, allowing Jobs to change 
                    schools. The new house (a three-bedroom home on Crist Drive in Los Altos, California) was in the 
                    better Cupertino School District, Cupertino, California, and was embedded in an environment that was even more 
                    heavily populated with engineering families than the Mountain View area was. The house was declared a 
                    historic site in 2013, as it was the first site for Apple Computer; as of 2013, it was owned by Patty and occupied 
                    by Jobs's step-mother, Marilyn. When he was 13 in 1968, Jobs was given a summer job by Bill Hewlett (of Hewlett-Packard) 
                    after Jobs cold-called him to ask for parts for an electronics project</p>
